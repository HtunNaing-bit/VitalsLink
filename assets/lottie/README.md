# Lottie Animation Files

This directory should contain Lottie animation files (.json).

## Required Files

1. **confetti.json** - Confetti celebration animation
   - Used in: Goal completion celebrations

2. **chart_loader.json** - Chart loading animation
   - Used in: Chart loading states

## Placeholder

For now, the app will work without these animations.
To add animations:
1. Create animations in Lottie (https://lottiefiles.com)
2. Export as .json files
3. Place them in this directory
4. Update the asset paths in the code if needed
